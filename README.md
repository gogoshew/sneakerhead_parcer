Hello

I just wanted to buy sneakers for the summer and created a parser to track discounts.

I have used technologies such as Beautifulsoup from bs4, requests, and couple another libraries for more convenience.

All information is recorded in data.json file with current date.

Enjoy it if you're russian! :)

P.S.
Just because it's russian website.
